# Habit Tracking and Analysis (Loop Android based)

## Description
This project provides a comprehensive solution for tracking and analyzing personal habits. Built in Python and utilizing SQLite for data storage, it offers a robust framework for monitoring various habits, setting goals, and evaluating progress over time. The application is designed to cater to individuals seeking a systematic approach to habit formation and lifestyle improvement.

## Features
- **Habit Tracking**: Users can track a variety of habits, such as calorie intake, weight, mindfulness levels, and overall wellness scores.
- **Time-Period Analysis**: Supports analysis of habit data for specific time periods, such as the current week or all-time records, facilitating short-term and long-term progress assessment.
- **Statistical Insights**: Generates average and total statistics for each habit, enabling users to gauge their consistency and dedication.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares current performance against historical averages to indicate whether the user is improving, maintaining, or regressing in their habits.

## How to Use
- **Database Setup**: Ensure that SQLite database `Loop_2024-01-15.db` is set up with the necessary tables and data.
- **Running the Analysis**: Execute the script to perform habit analysis. It will automatically calculate the current week's dates and analyze data for the current week and all previous time.
- **Viewing Results**: The script outputs habit data including averages and totals for the selected time frames. It also provides a summary comparing current performance with historical data.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- SQLite3

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install Python 3 and SQLite3 if not already installed.
3. Ensure the database file `Loop_2024-01-15.db` is placed in the same directory as the script.
